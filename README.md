SF Food Truck Application

This Application allows users to see the nearby food trucks. It is still under development and has only landing page. When the user opens the app and clicks on "Get Food Trucks" button, application makes a backend call with the location of the user and returns all the food trucks within 1 mile radius. 

Application has been implemented on Cordova, so it can run on both Android and IOS devices.
